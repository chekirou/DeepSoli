abstract = {Direct use of the hand as an input device is an attractive method for providing natural human-computer interaction (HCI). Currently, the only technology that satisfies the advanced requirements of hand-based input for HCI is glove-based sensing. This technology, however , has several drawbacks including that it hinders the ease and naturalness with which the user can interact with the computer-controlled environment, and it requires long calibration and setup procedures. Computer vision (CV) has the potential to provide more natural, non-contact solutions. As a result, there have been considerable research efforts to use the hand as an input device for HCI. In particular, two types of research directions have emerged. One is based on gesture classification and aims to extract high-level abstract information corresponding to motion patterns or postures of the hand. The second is based on pose estimation systems and aims to capture the real 3D motion of the hand. This paper presents a literature review on the latter research direction, which is a very challenging problem in the context of HCI.},

abstract = {This paper presents WiSee, a novel gesture recognition system that leverages wireless signals (e.g., Wi-Fi) to enable whole-home sensing and recognition of human gestures. Since wireless signals do not require line-of-sight and can traverse through walls, WiSee can enable whole-home gesture recognition using few wireless sources. Further, it achieves this goal without requiring instrumentation of the human body with sensing devices. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of WiSee using USRP-N210s and evaluate it in both an office environment and a two-bedroom apartment. Our results show that WiSee can identify and classify a set of nine gestures with an average accuracy of 94{\%}.},

It also allows for robust tracking, rapidly recovering from any temporary failures. Most uniquely, our tracker is highly flexible, dramatically improving upon previous approaches which have focused on front-facing close-range scenarios. This flexibility opens up new possibilities for human-computer interaction with examples including tracking at distances from tens of centimeters through to several meters (for controlling the TV at a distance), supporting tracking using a moving depth camera (for mobile scenarios), and arbitrary camera placements (for VR headsets). These features are achieved through a new pipeline that combines a multi-layered discriminative reinitialization strategy for per-frame pose estimation, followed by a generative model-fitting stage. We provide extensive technical details and a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis.},

abstract = {Figure 1. We explore interactive possibilities enabled by Google's project Soli (A), a solid-state short-range radar, capturing energy reflected of hands and other objects (B). The signal is unique in that it resolves motion in the millimeter range but does not directly capture shape (C). We propose a novel gesture recognition algorithm specifically designed to recognize subtle, low-effort gestures based on the Soli signal. ABSTRACT This paper proposes a novel machine learning architecture , specifically designed for radio-frequency based gesture recognition. We focus on high-frequency (60 GHz), short-range radar based sensing, in particular Google's Soli sensor. The signal has unique properties such as resolving motion at a very fine level and allowing for segmentation in range and velocity spaces rather than image space. This enables recognition of new types of inputs but poses significant difficulties for the design of input recognition algorithms. The proposed algorithm is capable of detecting a rich set of dynamic gestures and can resolve small motions of fingers in fine detail. Our technique is based on an end-to-end trained combination of deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The algorithm achieves high recognition rates (avg 87{\%}) on a challenging set of 11 dynamic gestures and generalizes well across 10 users. The proposed model runs on commodity hardware at 140 Hz (CPU only).},

However, it is still relatively costly to deploy robust gesture recognition sensors in existing mobile platforms. We present SoundWave, a technique that leverages the speaker and microphone already embedded in most commodity devices to sense in-air gestures around the device. To do this, we generate an inaudible tone, which gets frequency-shifted when it reflects off moving objects like the hand. We measure this shift with the microphone to infer various gestures. In this note, we describe the phenomena and detection algorithm, demonstrate a variety of gestures, and present an informal evaluation on the robustness of this approach across different devices and people.

In particular, we introduce a novel randomized decision forest (RDF) based hand shape classifier, and use it in a novel multi-layered RDF framework for articulated hand pose estimation. This classifier assigns the input depth pixels to hand shape classes, and directs them to the corresponding hand pose estimators trained specifically for that hand shape. We introduce two novel types of multi-layered RDFs: Global Expert Network (GEN) and Local Expert Network (LEN), which achieve significantly better hand pose estimates than a single-layered skeleton estimator and generalize better to previously unseen hand poses. The novel hand shape classifier is also shown to be accurate and fast. The methods run in real-time on the CPU, and can be ported to the GPU for further increase in speed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {We present a novel machine learning based algorithm extending the interaction space around mobile devices. The technique uses only the RGB camera now commonplace on off-the-shelf mobile devices. Our algorithm robustly recognizes a wide range of in-air gestures, supporting user variation, and varying lighting conditions. We demonstrate that our algorithm runs in real-time on unmodified mobile devices, including resource-constrained smartphones and smartwatches. Our goal is not to replace the touchscreen as primary input device, but rather to augment and enrich the existing interaction vocabulary using gestures. While touch input works well for many scenarios, we demonstrate numerous interaction tasks such as mode switches, application and task management, menu selection and certain types of navigation, where such input can be either complemented or better served by inair gestures. This removes screen real-estate issues on small touchscreens, and allows input to be expanded to the 3D space around the device. We present results for recognition accuracy (93{\%} test and 98{\%} train), impact of memory footprint and other model parameters. Finally, we report results from preliminary user evaluations, discuss advantages and limitations and conclude with directions for future work.},

Hand gesture recognition using radar can be applied to control electronic appliances. Compared with an optical recognition system, radar can work regardless of light conditions and it can be embedded in a case. We classify ten different hand gestures, with only micro-Doppler signatures on spectrograms without range information. The ten gestures, which included swiping from left to right, swiping from right to left, rotating clockwise, rotating counterclockwise, pushing, double pushing, holding, and double holding, were measured using Doppler radar and their spectrograms investigated. A DCNN was employed to classify the spectrograms, with 90{\%} of the data utilized for training and the remaining 10{\%} for validation. After five-fold validation, the classification accuracy of the proposed method was found to be 85.6{\%}. With seven gestures, the accuracy increased to 93.1{\%}.},

This paper proposes a hand gesture recognition system for a real-time application of HCI using 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar, Soli, developed by Google. The overall system includes signal processing part that generates range-Doppler map (RDM) sequences without clutter and machine learning part including a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder to learn the temporal characteristics of the RDM sequences.

abstract = {Recently, hand gesture recognition systems have become increasingly interesting to researchers in the field of human-computer interfaces. Real-world systems for human dynamic hand gesture recognition is challenging as: 1) the system must be robust to various conditions; 2) there is a rich diversity in how people perform hand gestures, making hand gesture recognition difficult; and 3) the system must detect and recognize hand gestures continuously using unsegmented input streams in order to avoid noticeable lag between performing a gesture and its classification. In this paper, to address these challenges, we present Latern, a novel system for dynamic continuous hand gesture recognition based on a frequency-modulated continuous wave radar sensor. The radar system does not depend on lighting, noise, or atmospheric conditions. We employ a recurrent 3-D convolutional neural network to perform the classification of dynamic hand gestures. To enhance the processing performance, a connectionist temporal classification algorithm is used to train the network to predict class labels from inprogress gestures in unsegmented input streams. The experimental results show that Latern is able to achieve high recognition rates of 96{\%}, which is higher than state-of-the-art hand gesture recognition systems. In addition, the conclusion in this paper can be used for a real-time hand gesture recognition system design.},
